# Monitoring-Fire-with-Telegram-Notifications
This is a telemetry project which is send data from transmitter to receiver. I use 2 ESP32 to send data to each other with WiFi communication. So, ESP32 have to connected into one WiFi SSID to be able send data to each other. The ESP32's transmitter will access IP Address from ESP32's receiver, so the transmitter only send data into that IP Address from receiver.
This project uses a flame sensor to detect flame. The working principle of a flame sensor is that it detects the electromagnetic waves generated by the flame. When flame sensor detceting flame, the program will send a massage that "there is a fire" into telegram by using bot that we created before.
